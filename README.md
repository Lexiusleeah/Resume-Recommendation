Research: “Resume Recommendation”. Created a model to classify job descriptions into their respective attributes. The tools utilized were topic modeling using Gensim in NLP and a PDF reader. Utilized NLTK, Sklearn, Scipy, Wordcloud, Gensim, and pdfplumber. Feature engineering, wordcloud visualization, topic modeling using gensim in NLP, preprocessing the dataset, create a dictionary, and build models. Predictive analysis to examine patterns, ranges, and biases through data mining, clustering/classification, data modeling, and data summarization.
